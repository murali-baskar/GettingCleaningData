# GettingCleaningData - Coursera project
1. The inertial data is not considered for this assignment
2. The test and train data are first filtered to select only the mean and standard deviation variables for easier processing
3. Implemented the suggestion made in the discussion pages of "coursera" to use "colClasses" and extract the test and train data
4. Referred to online notes for getting help on how to use the melt and dcast functions
