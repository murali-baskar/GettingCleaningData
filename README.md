# GettingCleaningData - Coursera project
1. The inertial data is not considered for this assignment
2. The test and train data are first filtered for the mean and standard deviation data and then merged for easier processing
3. Implemented the suggestion made in the discussion pages of this project to use colClasses and extract the test and train data
4. Referred to online notes for getting help on how to use the melt and dcast functions
